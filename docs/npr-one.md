# Pushing Posts to NPR One 

You can easily push posts to the [NPR One mobile app](http://www.npr.org/about/products/npr-one/) in addition to the NPR API. 

After you [set up the WordPress NPR API Plugin](settings.md) with your API Key and Org ID, you will see a new checkbox in the Post Edit screen for "Send to NPR One":

The checkbox is not selected by default. This allows you to push all your stories to the NPR API, but only selected stories to NPR One. 

If you want to push a post to NPR One, check the box and hit the Publish or Update button.
